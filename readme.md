## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Judge0 (Local Execution Environment)

This section details how to set up Judge0, which powers the multi-language DSA practice.

### **Step 1: Install WSL and Ubuntu (Windows Users)**

1.  **Enable WSL**
    - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
        ```powershell
        wsl --install
        ```
    - This will install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) along with the default Ubuntu distribution.

2.  **Restart Your Computer**
    - After the installation, you‚Äôll be prompted to restart your computer.
    - Restart to complete the WSL setup.

3.  **Complete Ubuntu Setup**
    - Open the **Ubuntu terminal** from the Start menu.
    - Follow the prompts to create a UNIX username and password.

4.  **Update Ubuntu**
    - Once Ubuntu is set up, run the following commands to update all packages:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        ```

5.  *(Optional)* **Adjust cgroup settings for better Docker compatibility**
    - Open the GRUB config file:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/default/grub
        ```
    - Find the line starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` and change it to:
        ```bash
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
        ```
    - Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl + X`).
    - Update GRUB and reboot:
        ```bash
        sudo update-grub
        sudo reboot
        ```

### **Step 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose**

1.  **Install Docker**
    - Open the **Ubuntu terminal** and run:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io
        ```
    - (Note: It's better to install `docker.io` package for Ubuntu.)

2.  **Install Docker Compose**
    - Still in the Ubuntu terminal, install Docker Compose:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install -y docker-compose
        ```

        ```
    - Unzip the downloaded archive:
        ```bash
        unzip judge0-v1.13.1.zip
        ```

2.  **Set Up Secure Passwords**
    - **Generate random passwords** for Redis and Postgres:
        - Visit [Random Password Generator](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=32&format=plain&rnd=new) and copy the first password.
        - Open the `.env` file within the unzipped Judge0 directory:
            ```bash
            nano judge0-v1.13.1/.env
            ```
        - Update the `REDIS_PASSWORD` with the generated password.
        - Repeat the process for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` using a new random password.

3.  **Start Judge0 Services**
    - Navigate to the Judge0 folder:
        ```bash
        cd judge0-v1.13.1
        ```
    - Start the database and Redis services:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d db redis
        ```
    - Wait for a few seconds:
        ```bash
        sleep 10s
        ```
    - Start the remaining services:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
    - Wait a few more seconds:
        ```bash
        sleep 5s
        ```

4.  **Verify the Installation**
    - Open your browser and visit:
        ```
        http://localhost:2358/docs
        ```
